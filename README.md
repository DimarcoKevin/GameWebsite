This is the original copy with no functionality to it. It just has a completed HTML and CSS template. 

This application will not size well on a mobile device. 
The styling was written in regular CSS and does not understand small screen formats.

I may come back at a later date and comeplete the JS to add functionality to the games.
I may also come back and use a better form of styling (maybe bootstrap).

This branch will always contain the original copy from second semester Web Development at Sheridan college.
Any changes will be pushed to the master branch or will be posted on a new branch in the future.
