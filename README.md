This is a project I started in second semester Web Development at Sheridan. 

I didn't have the time to complete the functionality at the time. So I only made a visual template.

I have found this old project and decided to post it to github for my portfolio.

I may come back in the future and complete the JS functionality for the five games.
I also may come back and make a responsive styling. (Bootstrap instead of plain css)
